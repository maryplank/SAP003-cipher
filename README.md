# Caesar's Cipher

Caesar's cipher is the perfect way to exchange those secret notes at school! You can still decript it easyly by your own, if you know your key, and still protect it from the teacher or other studants that has nothing to do with your business.
Create a secret way to communicate with your friends!

If you want a program that will encript and decript your notes automatically for you, this is your program! Just type the text you want to encript, or the text you received and you want to decript, and we will do all the work for you.

## Usage

1. Acess the program.
http:// .....

2. Type your text
On the top text-box, type the text you want to cipher or decipher. You can go nuts and write as many lines as you want, there is no limit.

3. Insert secret key
On the middle box, type a numeric key to encode or decode. It may be a negative number to really mess with whoever tries to decode your note. It must be an integer (you can try to type a decimal number, it just wont work)

4. Choose an operation
YOu can, then, cipher or decipher the text you entered. 
*For the curious ones:* cipher will add the key value to the alphabet letters, ignoring non-alphabetical characters. Decipher will decrease the key value from the letters. Inputing a negative key will work the other way around.

5. See your secret code!
See your secret or not-so-secret-anymore message show up at the bottom text-box. Copy it to send an encripted message or just read the decripted message.

Hope you guys like it :)
